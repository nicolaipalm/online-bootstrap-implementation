        **When to apply:**
        These weights are only valid for iid data_old.

    Generate number-of-samples many realizations of moving average weights.

    **Formula**

    .. math ::

        V_i = \sum_{j\in \mathcal{Z}} b_j \eta_{i-j}

        m = n^{\frac{1}{3}}

        |j|\leq m

    and 0 else.
