    """Perform the weighted bootstrap

    The weighted bootstrap generates new samples from a given sample set
    by multiplying each sample with a random weight, i.e.

    .. math::
        \tilde{X_i}=V_iX_i

    where X is the sample and V is the random weight.
    This bootstrap procedure may be used for iid samples but also for weakly dependent samples
    by using suitable weights.
    The weights are specified in a sequence of the same length
    as the samples.
    See the weight module for more information.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate 2-dependent (non-iid) samples X according to

    .. math::
        X_i = Y_i+a*Y_{i+1}

    with Y all iid normally distributed

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from bstrapping.bootstrap_procedures.weighted_bootstrap import WeightedBootstrap
    >>> from bstrapping.weights.auto_regressive_weights import AutoRegressiveWeights
    >>> mean, variance, number_sample_points = 1, 2, 2500 # specify variance, mean and number of the samples
    >>> a = 0.8
    >>> Y = [np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=variance**(1/2)) for _ in range(number_sample_points+1)]
    >>> samples = np.array(Y[:-1]) + a * np.array(Y[1:])


    The true variance of the empirical mean of the samples is given by

    >>> true_variance = (1 + a) ** 2 / number_sample_points * variance
    0.002592

    Initialize weights for the weighted bootstrap, here, we use the recursive defined weights for weakly dependent data_old

    >>> weights = AutoRegressiveWeights(samples=samples)

    Perform the weighted bootstrap

    >>> bootstrap = WeightedBootstrap(samples=samples, weights=weights, number_bootstrap_samples=1000)

    Calculate the variance of the empirical mean of bootstrapped samples

    >>> bootstrap.bootstrapped_variance
    0.0025440628841643504 # may vary
