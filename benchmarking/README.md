This submodule contains benchmark and plotting scripts for

* hyperparameter comparison of the AR online bootstrap in terms of mean and variance
* comparison of the AR online bootstrap with the iid and MA bootstrap methods in terms of their
  * accuracy
  * validity
  * runtime

The source code of the underlying bootstrap procedures is (partly) found in the bstrapping submodule.
Simply run the respective jupyter notebooks in the ``./multiprocessing/`` directory to reproduce the results.
